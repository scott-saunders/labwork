## Purpose


## Protocol 

Essentially the same protocol was used as 1/08/19:

1. Biofilms were grown in reactors with minimal succinate medium for 4 days, at ~30 degrees C, as usual. 
2. Before any echem, one biofilm was submerged in a 10uM trioxsalen solution in a petri dish (from 2mM EtOH stock) and exposed to 365nm light from a handheld lamp placed directly above it. The other biofilm was submerged in MM succ with an ethanol control.
3. After an hour of treatment, the biofilms were briefly left in the petri dishes, but the UVA light was turned off. 
4. I then used a non-equilibrium type protocol, similar to the one first attempted on 12_10_18.
5. To measure $D_{ap}$ I performed the following echem:
  * Soak only working electrode part of IDA (100mL liquid in reactor) in 75uM PYO in MM succ medium for at least 10 min. Take SWV fast scan in soak reactor. During soak, make sure that transfer reactor has 180mL fresh MM succ medium and that it is stirring with N2 bubbling to make anaerobic and equilibrate temperature.
  * Hook up counter and reference in transfer reactor. Remove the biofilm from the soak reactor, dip once in a MM succ wash, and then transfer to other reactor. Connect working electrodes and check open circuit potential (OCP). Take first SWV fast scan. Try to time the seconds between immersing the biofilm in the transfer reactor and starting the first scan. 
  * Run a 1 segment GC ( +0.2 to -0.4 V only ~2min), and then immediately run an SWV fast* to pair the data. Repeat for ~30min when the signals start to level off.  
6. To measure $D_{m}$ I performed the following echem:
  * The first step was the exact same as the first  bullet point for $D_{ap}$.
  * Prepare a SWV fast repetitive run in the software (56 sec gap, repeat 60 times).
  * Hook up counter and reference in transfer reactor. Remove the biofilm from the soak reactor, dip once in a MM succ wash, and then transfer to other reactor. Connect working electrodes and check open circuit potential (OCP). Start the repetitive run. Try to time the seconds between immersing the biofilm in the transfer reactor and starting the first scan. 
  
*SWV slow was run several times for the psoralen biofilms because of high background current.
  
Note that I had two potentiostats running. There were three chambers total, 1 soak and 2 transfers, so only one biofilm could soak at one time, but two transfers could be monitored simultaneously. I kept the biofilms staggered, first control, then psoralen, but I made sure that much of the transfer time overlapped to try to make it efficient.
