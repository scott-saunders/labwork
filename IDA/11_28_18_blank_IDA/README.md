# Experiment Overview

Date: 11_28_18

## Purpose

The purpose of this experiment was to estimate $D_{ap}$ and $D_m$ for a blank IDA. This will serve as a control / comparison to the IDA biofilms - we expect $D_{ap}$ and $D_m$ to both be fast and very similar. 

## Protocol

1. A blank IDA was exposed to increasing soak concentrations of PYO (0,1,5,10,25,50,75,100uM). 
  * GC, SWV and SWVfast scans were taken. 
2. the soaked IDA was transferred to a fresh reactor and the decay was monitored through SWVfast scans. 


## Data

The data in the Data folder comes from the blank electrode while it was either in the soak reactor or the transfer reactor. SWVfast decays are numbered in the order they were taken. GCs and SWVs were taken with the usual parameters.
