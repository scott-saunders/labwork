I have been led down a path to create this notebook after seeing some very unintuitive things regarding the nonlinear fits of my SWV decays. As a reality/sanity check I want to generate some data from my known diffusion equation and use a nonlinear least squares to estimate a coefficient and calculate the original parameters. This should work. **If this doesn't work, then I don't understand something important about this simple set of equations.**

## Some Basic Theory

Recall that the current from SWV scans can be assumed to fit a 1D diffusion profile of the form:

$$C(t)=\frac{2 M_0}{A \sqrt{4 \pi D_m t}}$$
Using the equation for square wave voltammetry current and subsituting for $C$ and $M_0$, we get the following expression. 

$$I_{swv}=I_0 \frac{\sqrt{D_{ap} t_s}}{\sqrt{4 D_m t}}$$
With this expression we can calculate an $I_{swv}$ for a datapoint given the time, $t$ and the parameters $I_0$,$D_{ap}$, $D_m$, and $t_s$. **We will use this to generate a test dataset.**

Then if we are going to fit data from this expression, we can assume it is of the form

$$y=m t^{-\frac{1}{2}}+b$$
If we fit for that coefficient, $m$, then $D_m$ is the following
$$D_m=\frac{I_0^2 D_{ap} t_s}{4 m^2}$$
We will use this equation to decode our "fit" back into a $D_m$, which should be close to the original value we generated the data with. 

## Generate Some Data

First, let's write a function to generate a dataset with known parameters.

```{r}
generate_Iswv <- function(t,I0=1,D_ap=1e-5,D_m=1e-8,t_s=0.1,noise=T,sd=0.1){
  t=t
  Iswv <- I0*(sqrt(D_ap*t_s)/sqrt(4*D_m*t))
  
  if(noise){
    Iswv <- rnorm(length(t),mean=Iswv,sd=sd)
  }
  
  Iswv
}
```

Ok, so if we give this function timepoints, and parameters $I_0$, $D_{ap}$, $D_m$ and $t_s$, it will calculate what the measured $I_{swv}$ current will be. We can also tell the function if we want normally distributed noise. 

```{r}

#Params
I0=10
D_ap=1e-6
D_m=1e-7
t_s=0.1

t = seq(1, 50, length = 100)

gen_data <- tibble(t,i=generate_Iswv(t, I0, D_ap , D_m, t_s, noise=T))

kable(head(gen_data))
```

Ok, that seems to work well, let's see what the current decay looks like. The $I_0$ is shown as a dashed line. 

```{r}
ggplot(gen_data,aes(x=t,y=i))+geom_point()+
  geom_hline(yintercept = I0,linetype=2)
```

## Fit the Generated Data

Beautiful, now let's write a function that can take in that generated data and attempt to back calculate the correct $D_m$. 

```{r}

calc_D_m <- function(df,t=t,i=i,D_ap,t_s,i_0=NA){
  if(is.na(i_0)){
    i_0 = max(df$i)
  }
  fit = nls(i~m*t^-0.5+b,data=df,start=c(m=0.1,b=0))
  
  m=as.numeric(coef(fit)[1])
  b=as.numeric(coef(fit)[2])
  
  D_m=(i_0^2 * D_ap * t_s) / (4*m^2)
  
  c(D_m=D_m,i_0=i_0,b=b)
}

```

So, this function will take in our generated df. We will also provide it with a $D_{ap}$ and $t_s$. 

```{r}
(estimates <- calc_D_m(gen_data,D_ap=D_ap,t_s=t_s))
```

Ok, so the function runs...**but its estimate is about an order of magnitude off**...not great for data that we just generated. Recall that $I_0$ was `r I0`, it seems that could be an important problem if using the max point to estimate $I_0$ doesn't work well. You can see that by reruning the calculation function, but providing the correct $I_0$ enables the fit to estimate $D_m$ very accurately. 

```{r}
calc_D_m(gen_data,D_ap=D_ap,t_s=t_s,i_0=I0)

```

Now, providing the correct $I_0$ yields a very good estimate for $D_m$, recall that we originally set it to `r D_m` cm^2/sec.

Let's look at a plot of the original data with data regenerated from the estimated fit parameters:
```{r}
#generate dataset from estimates
calc_data <- tibble(t,i=generate_Iswv(t, I0=estimates[2], D_ap , D_m=estimates[1], t_s, noise=T))

#plot with I0's
ggplot(gen_data,aes(x=t,y=i))+geom_point()+
  geom_hline(yintercept = I0,linetype=2)+
  geom_point(data=calc_data,color='red')+
  geom_hline(yintercept = estimates[2],color='red',linetype=2)+
  ylim(0,NA)

```

Here you can see that the original dataset in black is perfectly overlaid by our back calculated data. However, because we assumed that $I_0$ was equal to the max datapoint (red dotted line), we underestimated the true $I_0$ (black dotted line) by about half. The fit then calculated the $D_m$ to be much slower to make the data fit nicely...

### Takeaway 1
This brings up an important question that I thought I understood, but now I'm confused: "How can we accurately estimate $I_0$ from these SWV decays?" Up to this point I had just been using the first/max datapoint and normalizing by that. However, this notebook is showing me that this approach only gets you an order of magnitude accuracy (with these params).

## Quick Repeat with Different Params

This time, let's look at a dataset over the course of an hour, with a realistic $I_0$ of 1uA, and $D_m$ of 1e-9 cm^2/sec.
```{r}
I0_v2 = 1e-6
D_m_v2 = 1e-9

gen_data_100 <- tibble(t=seq(10,3600,by=10),
                       i=generate_Iswv(t=t, I0=I0_v2, D_ap , D_m = D_m_v2, t_s, noise=T,sd=2e-8))

ggplot(gen_data_100,aes(x=t/60,y=i))+geom_point()+geom_hline(yintercept = I0_v2,linetype=2)

```

Interestingly, when $D_m$ and $t$ are small enough, you can actually get signal larger than $I_0$. Using the same metric of the max data point to estimate $I_0$ now yields an **overestimate.**

NLS estimates:
```{r}
(estimates_100 <- calc_D_m(gen_data_100,D_ap=D_ap,t_s=t_s))
```

Estimates when provided with correct $I_0$
```{r}
calc_D_m(gen_data_100,D_ap=D_ap,t_s=t_s,i_0 = I0_v2)
```

Again, we see that the error in the $I_0$ estimate throws off the $D_m$ estimate by 2.5x. And the plot shows the same effect as before - incorrect $I_0$ estimates will force the fit to adjust the $D_m$.

```{r}
calc_data_100 <- tibble(t=seq(10,3600,by=10),
                        i=generate_Iswv(t=t, I0=estimates_100[2], D_ap , D_m=estimates_100[1], t_s, noise=T,sd=1e-8))

ggplot(gen_data_100,aes(x=t,y=i))+geom_point()+
  geom_hline(yintercept = I0_v2,linetype=2)+
  geom_point(data=calc_data_100,color='red')+
  geom_hline(yintercept = estimates_100[2],color='red',linetype=2)+
  ylim(0,NA)
```

Lastly, here's a plot showing how the curve can shift drastically with $D_m$ or $I_0$.
```{r}
t = seq(0,3600,by=10)
play_data_5_8 <- tibble(t,i=generate_Iswv(t=t, I0=1e-5, D_ap=1e-6 , D_m=1e-8, t_s, noise=F)) %>% 
    mutate(Dm=1e-8,I_0=1e-5)
play_data_5_10 <- tibble(t,i=generate_Iswv(t=t, I0=1e-5, D_ap=1e-6 , D_m=1e-10, t_s, noise=F)) %>% 
    mutate(Dm=1e-10,I_0=1e-5)

play_data_6_8 <- tibble(t,i=generate_Iswv(t=t, I0=1e-6, D_ap=1e-6 , D_m=1e-8, t_s, noise=F)) %>% 
    mutate(Dm=1e-8,I_0=1e-6)

play_data_4_8 <- tibble(t,i=generate_Iswv(t=t, I0=1e-4, D_ap=1e-6 , D_m=1e-8, t_s, noise=F)) %>% 
  mutate(Dm=1e-8,I_0=1e-4)

play_data <- bind_rows(play_data_5_8,play_data_5_10,play_data_6_8,play_data_4_8) %>% 
  mutate(params = paste('D_m=',Dm," I0=",I_0))
#calc_data <- tibble(t,i=generate_Iswv(t, I0=I0, D_ap , D_m=estimates[1], t_s, noise=T))

ggplot(play_data,aes(x=t/60,y=i,color=params))+
  geom_jitter(width=1)
```
You can actually see that wildly different combinations of $D_m$ and $I_0$ give identical decay curves...therefore estimating $I_0$ is important. 

## Final Takeaways

What I take away from this notebook, is when we underestimate $I_0$, the fit simply underestimates $D_m$ to compensate. Because $I_0$ and $D_m$ are both in the slope term, they can be adjusted against each other to get pretty much any value. Therefore we cannot simply fit for $I_0$, it will be unidentifiable from $D_m$. Recall:

$$I_{swv}=I_0 \frac{\sqrt{D_{ap} t_s}}{\sqrt{4 D_m t}}$$

In this notebook, maybe the errors seemed tolerable, within an order of magnitude. However, imagine what happens when our sampling rate is much lower, as in our experiments. I would predict that with the current experimental design and analysis workflow, **we are seriously underestimating** $I_0$. I do not know how much error we have, but I think it is safe to assume that it is larger than the artificial system that we have worked with in this notebook. **Therefore, we need a reasonable way to estimate $I_0$** or clarify that we are estimating it well, by using the first datapoint. 

### How to estimate $I_0$? 
* Take first data point - underestimates significantly
* Transform data point by some metric - what metric?
* take SWV signal from soak before transfer - we usually wash before transfer, so I think this would overestimate. Maybe if we don't wash, but then we will almost surely have multiple diffusion processes happening. 
* Take last datapoint/asymptote - this should just be a measure of how much PYO the biofilm holds onto and how much accumulates in the media. I don't see why this value would be connected to how much PYO was initially there.
