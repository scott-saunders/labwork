# Experiment Overview

## Purpose

The purpose of this experiment was test whether treating a biofilm with Psoralen affected the measured $D_{ap}$ compared to an untreated control. The idea is that when exposed to UVA light, intercalated psoralen molecules form mono, and eventually diadducts that break the pi bonds of the psoralen and crosslinked nucleotides. This breaking of pi bonds is predicted to disrupt DNA charge transfer. Therefore if PYO participates in DNA CT in the biofilm, treatment with Psoralen might cause a perceived decrease in $D_{ap}$.

## Protocol

1. Biofilms were grown in reactors with minimal succinate medium for 4 days, at ~30 degrees C, as usual. 
2. Before any echem, one biofilm was submerged in a 10uM trioxsalen solution in a petri dish (from 2mM EtOH stock) and exposed to 365nm light from a handheld lamp placed directly above it. The other biofilm was submerged in MM succ with an ethanol control.
3. After an hour of treatment, the biofilms were returned to the cleaned reactors. The typical echem experimental protocol was followed.
  * Biofilms were soaked in 5 different concentrations of PYO (25,50,75,100,200uM). SWV and GC scans were taken in the soak. 
  * After soak, biofilms were dipped in fresh MM succ to wash and then transferred to a reactor with fresh medium and the SWV decay was monitored for ~1hr. 
  * After an hour the system was assumed to be near equilibrium and GC scans were taken. 
4. At some point I thought it would be interesting to make a measurement of the equilibrium solution on a blank electrode, so those measurements were taken before and after the biofilm was placed in the fresh chamber.

## Data

The data in the Data folder comes from 3 different electrodes: Control (untreated biofilm), Psoralen (treated biofilm), or blank (used to measure background solution from both biofilms).

The GCs were all taken at 3mVs with two sweep segments. The SWVs were "slow" taken at 15hz. The appended numbers indicate the sequence of SWV scans.
