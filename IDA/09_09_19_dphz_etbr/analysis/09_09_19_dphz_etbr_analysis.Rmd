# Intro

# Methods

In duplicate (biofilms A and B) an IDA biofilm was exposed to three different conditions sequentially:

1. Normal transfer. 75uM PYO (in PBS 50) to PBS
2. Transfer to EtBr. 75uM PYO (in PBS 50) to 10uM EtBr (in PBS)
2. Soak in EtBr and Transfer to EtBr. 75uM PYO + 10uM EtBr (in PBS 50) to 10uM EtBr (in PBS)

Note that biofilm B was dropped facedown prior to imaging.
