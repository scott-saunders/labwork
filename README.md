# labwork
Welcome! This is my labwork git repository. 

Just to orient you, each folder will have at least a few different filetypes:

1. __README.md__ - This file is automatically displayed on github and provides a little information about the folder.
2. __"notebook".rmd__  - This is an rmarkdown notebook that I use to document code based workflows in R. This will appear as plain text.
3. __"notebook".md__ - This is a github markdown version of the .rmd notebook, so that you can easily view the notebook rendered on github.
4. __"notebook".html__ - This is a fully rendered HTML version of the notebook that may have interactive features etc. This file will automatically be incorporated into the public facing [website](scott-saunders.github.io/labwork) under it's subfolder and filename.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
